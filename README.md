# 🏆 Meta Hacker Cup

The **Meta Hacker Cup** is an annual global programming competition hosted by **Meta (formerly Facebook)**.  
It challenges participants to solve algorithmic and mathematical problems efficiently, testing their skills in problem-solving, coding, and optimization.

## 📚 Overview

The competition consists of multiple rounds:
- **Qualification Round** – Open to everyone; a warm-up round to qualify for Round 1.
- **Round 1** – Divided into sub-rounds (1A, 1B, 1C); participants can qualify through any one of them.
- **Round 2** – More challenging problems with tighter constraints.
- **Round 3** – The top contestants advance to the final.
- **Final Round** – The best global coders compete for the title and prizes.

## 💻 Rules & Format

- Each round lasts for a fixed duration (usually **72 hours** for online rounds).
- Problems are algorithmic in nature and require efficient code.
- Submissions are uploaded as source files (e.g., `.cpp`, `.py`, `.java`).
- Scoring is based on correctness and performance.
- Use of external libraries is limited to standard libraries only.
